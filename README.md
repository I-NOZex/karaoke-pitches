# [Pixels Camp 2016](https://pixels.camp) Presentation Karaoke Pitches

To compete in our mad Presentation Karaoke challenge, you must submit a (minimum) 10-topic presentation outline through a GitHub pull request.

Think of that presentation as you ideal pitch - it doesn't have to be real, or serious, or even feasible. Short, concise, creative and humorous score higher.

## How to compete

To submit your entry, follow the instructions below:

* Log in to **GitHub** or create an account.
* **Fork this repository**.
* **Duplicate** the [my-pitch_my-name.md](https://github.com/PixelsCamp/talks/blob/master/my-pitch_my-name.md) file first and rename the **new file** after your pitch title and your name.  
(ex: my-trip-to-the-zoo-with_celso-martinho.md)
* Edit the **new file** and fill in each section.
* **Do not delete the template file.**
* When you're ready, **submit a pull request** and **comment** using your markdown file contents.
* Anyone can comment on your pull request. If your pitch is accepted we will merge it.
* Deadline for submitting pitches is **midnight, Oct 6th**. After than we won't be accepting more pull requests.

## What should be in the pitch?

Whatever you like, but we suggest:

* Your Name  (optionally followed by your Twitter handle)
* A catchy title
* At least bullet points (think of these as titles for each slide of your presentation)

You can add sub-topics at will, write short snippets of text and/or descriptions to each topic, or add pictures. Keep it civilized.

#### Related Files

If you want to include any other files related to your pitch (like pictures), make a directory with the same name as your pitch and put the files in there.

#### Contact Info

Make sure we have a way to contact you during the event! That's what the name is for.

## What are we looking for?

Again, we're looking for short, concise, creative and humorous, and a minimum of 10 topics/bullet points.
